Question 2
The equation of the linear regression is given by
 y= b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3(x1*x2)
         where y = the log of number of hours worked by an employer
               b0 = coefficient of the equation
               x1 = the Euro to Swiss Franc exchange rate
               b1 = coefficient of the Euro to Swiss Franc exchange rate
               x2 = dummy variable for cross border commuter
               b2 = coefficient of the dummy variable for cross border commuter
               x1*x2 = dummy variable and the exchange rate
               b3 = coefficient of x1*x2
         
         
Given the co-efficients, note; the lower the standard error, the better the estimates. That being said, the equation will be;
y = b0 + 0.93x1 + 0.8x2 + 1.12(x1*x2)


        R_Squared
Since R-squared explains the variability of the regression, it value ranges from 0-1, from our table, meaning our regression explained 41% of the variability of the independent variables (x)
